## Set Up Instructions

0. If you don't already have a github account, make an account at https://github.com/.

1. Fork this repository by clicking "Fork" on the top right corner

2. Go to your repositories and find the one that you just forked

3. Find the green button that says "Clone or Download", copy and paste the link

4. Go to your terminal, and go inside a directory that you want to put the project inside. If you're not sure what this means, here are a set of commands that you might find helpful (ignore the angle brackets, they are there to clarify that you're suppose to replace it). You can also skip all this and go directly to step 5. Let's assume our current location is "Desktop"
+ "mkdir <FILENAME>" makes a folder with the <FILENAME>, so for example, "mkdir Project" will create a new folder named Project in your current directory, which is "Desktop"
+ "cd" changes your directory, so for example, "cd Project" will change your current location to the Project folder
+ "cd .." allows you to change from your current location to your parent folder, so for example, if you're in the Project folder, "cd .." will change your location back to "Desktop"

5. Type "git clone <GIT URL>" into your terminal without the quotes and angular brackets. <GIT URL> is the link you copy pasted from Step 3.

Viola, you should have everything you need and you're done.


## How to Submit your own changes to your forked repository

0. Open your terminal

1. "cd" into the folder where your forked repostiory is (If you're already in it, you don't need to do anything)

2. If you want to add files one by one, you can do "git add <FILENAME>" If you want to submit everything, you can do "git add --all"

3. Commit your changes by typing "git commit -m <MESSAGE>", where <MESSAGE> is just a short description of what you're adding. You can't leave this blank.

4. Finally push all your changes into your repository by typing "git push". 

Viola, your repository now has all your changes.
